# Mu Maps

### 1. Introduction:
         	μ Maps (Mu Maps) is to provide all the possibility option in maps and navigation. So far we have map that only provides place information, direction, shortcuts, estimated time and traffic.
The μ Map is something different from normal maps. It provides location alert, daily shop, user mode (food, market, grocery, dress, shops, electronics and etc.,), voice information, preference based on user review, publishing the store offers on map, publishing advertisement on map, virtual shopping and other old options.

### 2. Location Alert:
    Location alert will be very useful to alert the user destination whatever like place, theatres, railway station, bus station and etc., It alerts the user before  500m- 2000m.

### 3. Daily Shop:
	Country like India there are many daily shop, they put shop for somedays. When people staying on new place wants to find cheap products around them. This will be helpful. In this option shop owner have to add the place and need to select how many hour shop will be there. 

### 4. Voice Info:	
	We all know that voice will be useful on navigations. But voice navigations tells only the road name and directions. It tells every place name and famous things in that place eg. You are in salem, this place known for mango. You can get fresh mango at retail place (shop owner can give advertisement here). Greeting the user by welcome to salem, goodbye. Toll info, toll price for our car.

### 5. User Mode:	
	In user mode, the user can select any of these mode (dress, food, grocery, hospital, shop and etc.,). It shows the nearby place with different icon based on the review of the store. So user can go best shop in that area.

### 6. Speed Limit:	
	We all know that speed limit varies based on the roads. But there are some chance driver may miss speed limit board. Here, we alert the driver about the speed limit of the road using the popup along with voice.

### 7. Virtual Shopping:
	Everyone goes for shopping, user may purchase something on a particular store in a particular area. After leaving the town user decided to purchase the same product from same shop.  User knows the address and shop name but there is no website for that shop. In this option shop owner can create a virtual shopping on the map and they can list out all the product in their store with price.  Now user can purchase the product from their favourite shop.

### 8. Advertisement/Offer on map:
	We can advertise on map and also we can show offer of the store in the map. By using popup owner can show their advertisement and also offer information.
